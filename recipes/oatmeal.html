    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>A hot bowl of oatmeal is one of the easiest, most satisfying breakfasts you can make — especially when peanut butter’s involved. This recipe will show you how to make the best, easiest peanut butter oatmeal in just 15 minutes, with instructions for both the stovetop and the microwave. Let’s get started.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk or water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 1/2 cups milk or water, 2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats and stir to combine. Cook, stirring often, until about 2/3 of the liquid has been absorbed by the oats, 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 minutes. (The oatmeal will still look very runny.) Remove the saucepan from the heat, cover, and let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover, add 2 tablespoons peanut butter, and stir until well combined. Serve immediately with your choice of toppings.</li>
    </ol>
